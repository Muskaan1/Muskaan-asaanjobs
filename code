3) Closest to zero 									    20 Marks

This problem is also called minimum absolute sum pair. You are given an array of integers, containing both +ve and -ve numbers. You need to find the two elements such that their sum is closest to zero. eg. Array [15, 5, -20, 30, -45] Output should be 15, -20.

Note: We want the sum to be closest to zero not minimum. The minimum in the above example would be (-20, -45), but that is incorrect.


#include<iostream.h>
#include<conio.h>
int main()
{
int arr[10],n,i;
cin>>n;
for( i=0;i<10;i++)
{
a=n+arr[i];
if(a<=0 && a>arr[i])
cout<<a;
}
}
